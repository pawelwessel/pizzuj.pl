## Updated Components

### PizzeriaManagement.js
- **Before**: 653 lines with all functionality embedded
- **After**: 120 lines with clean separation of concerns
- **Improvements**:
  - Removed large render functions
  - Cleaner state management
  - Better component organization
  - Easier to test and maintain

### MenuManagement.js
- **Before**: 535 lines with complex form rendering
- **After**: 200 lines with modular structure
- **Improvements**:
  - Separated form logic into dedicated component
  - Extracted card rendering into reusable component
  - Cleaner category filtering
  - Better empty state handling

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Maintainability**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused in other parts of the application
3. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to unit test
4. **Readability**: Code is more organized and easier to understand
5. **Performance**: Better component isolation can lead to optimized re-renders
6. **Developer Experience**: Easier to locate and modify specific functionality

## Next Steps
1. Consider extracting common UI patterns into shared components
2. Add PropTypes or TypeScript for better type safety
3. Implement unit tests for each component
4. Consider creating custom hooks for shared logic
5. Add error boundaries for better error handling
